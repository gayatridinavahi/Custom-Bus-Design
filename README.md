# Custom-Bus-Design

## Introduction
This is a custom built-bus architecture using a set of custom assumtions (protocols). <br/>
The design has been inspired by the design and functionality of the AMBA AHB/APB buses. Hence it consists of a blend of characteristics native to those bus arcitectures, albeit with significant performance and functionality limitations.

## Signals Diagram 
Attached below is the diagram representing the I/O signals of the bus.
